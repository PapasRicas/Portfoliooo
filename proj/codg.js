    Welcome to my quirky little experiment! This is one of my personal projects where the fun is all about playing with a command console. 
    Imagine this: the character's stuck in the center of the screen, and you—yes, you—get to type out commands 
    like 'move right' or 'move left' to get them moving. It's like a text-based adventure game, but with real-time character movement!<br>

    <br>So, how does it work? You type in your commands, string them together, and guide the character through the level. 
    It's as simple as that—or as complex as you make it. There's something oddly satisfying about watching a character navigate 
    a level based on the text commands you input. It's a game where your typing skills are your superpower.<br>

    <br>There's no fancy name for this one—just pure, unadulterated fun with a console. It's a bit of a wild ride and showcases 
    some of my early experiments with game mechanics and command-based interactions.<br>

    <br>Enjoy navigating this quirky creation and have fun with the command console!.
