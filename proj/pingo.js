Sr Pingo was a project where I took on the role of lead programmer. Initially, I wasn’t part of the team, but when their only developer left, I was brought in to take over. I handled all the programming using Ren'Py, even though I had no prior experience with it.

<br><br>Despite the initial challenge, I quickly learned Ren'Py and was responsible for the entire development process, from interactive mechanics to integrating visual and narrative elements. The result is a solid visual novel that I’m really proud of. You can check out the full gameplay here:

<br>I hope you enjoy the result as much as I enjoyed programming it.
